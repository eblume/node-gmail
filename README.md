Installation
------------

Coming soon - it should follow the standard `npm` routines, but I am new to `npm` and may have made mistakes.

Testing
-------

The testing suite for this library is a bit more complicated to set up then one would normally want, due to the fact that any tests that don't connect to a live GMail account are rather fragile. The following steps should make it easier, but unfortunately they are likely to break for people other than me at first. Input on this is welcome.

In order to set up the testing environment, first create (or have) a Google Mail (GMail.com) mail account. Then create a `test/test_settings.json` file in the format perscribed by `test/test_settings.json.example`.

Next, make sure you have a at least one recieved email. Additionally you need emails that (and these CAN be all just one email) have at least one attachment, and have at least one GMail label.

Once this is done, run `npm install` to create a module bundle in `./node_modules`, and then run `npm test` to run the test suites. They should all pass - if they do not, please file a bug!
